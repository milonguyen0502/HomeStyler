Smooth American black walnut veneer adds a natural warmth that contrasts beautifully with the cool grey glass accents and satin black hardware. Designed for one of Frattini's villas, the piece was originally conceived as a storage unit for the dressing area. Roomy drawers store office supplies, clothing or flatware on top with a cabinet at the bottom for larger items.",
